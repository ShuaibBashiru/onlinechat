# Simple guide

The source code named Server is divided into user and admin end, this only contains Php source code interacting with the user interfaces,
the user interface is also divided into user and admin. 
That is, the logic is divided in such away that Server is standalone and GUi is also standalone but they both interact asnychronously.



Step 1:
The servder code should be unzipped into any local server, be it, appserv, xampp or mamp for mac,
please note that the unzipped file will contain both admin and user server

Step 2:
unzip the Gui folder to any folder created in the local disk environment
